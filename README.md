# gomore
Gomore.dk data scraper.

This collects and saves the data openly available on gomore.dk with the purpose of analysing the database. I have no connection to gomore.dk nor own this information as it is accessible by anyone on the internet.

Gomore_IDs.py collects data IDs, names among other features displayed on the cars' list.

Gomore.py collects data from every individual car gathered in Gomore_ID and it might take some time to run.

I have added the files generated by the two scripts, after running them on 02/10/2020
